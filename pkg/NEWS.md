  - added possibility of image annotation; argument ‘label’ in
    ‘panel\_annotation’ can be object of class ‘array’

  - fixed divergent coloring for (only) two values in ‘cubehelix()’

  - ‘ggmap’, ‘foreign’ are removed from the list of suggested packages;

    geocoded place.

  - Introduce tiles to ‘glance’. Now static maps and tiles for basemap
    in “+proj=merc”

  - Dismiss from dQuote() and sQuote(), which put non-symmetrical quotes
    in Rgui; GDAL does’t understad it.

  - ‘inst/glance’ contains mock-up to create vector/raster file
    associantion with glance()

  - ‘glance’ can work without package ‘sf’; however “package:methods”
    should be in “search()”

  - Rename ‘panel\_gridline’ to ‘panel\_graticule’.

### version 3.7-1

  - Public wrapper ‘glance()’ for non-public ‘.glance()’: quick-look of

### version 3.6-2

    certificate for HTTPS

### version 3.6-1

  - Added ‘session\_pngviewer()’ and ‘session\_tempdir()’ to follow CRAN
    policy. If “Rscript”, then external software is used to open PNG;
    current directory is used to write files If ‘interactive()’ or “R
    CMD BATCH”, no external software for PNG; ‘tempdir()’ is used to
    write files

### version 3.5-2

  - Initial submission to R-Forge
